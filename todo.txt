[ ] FAB for adding top level
    - Items, Spells, Background/Notes/etc
    - Context menu for specific selections when relevant
[ ] Trim down on payloads for Firebase queries
    - Refactor Character model into groupings. Top level
      should be sufficient for the portrait only
[ ] Add items
[ ] Add spells
[ ] Character creation
[ ] Money
[ ] Equip items
[ ] Spell slots
[ ] Spell preparation for Wizard and Clerics
[ ] Empty equipment sections should ignore header
[ ] Remove WebPack cache busting for resources
[ ] Responsive
    - Ability Scores, Status, and Combat should display below portrait
      on phones. This will require re-laying out via JS
[ ] Multiple characters from server
    - Logic is currently janky. Should be cleaner updates of Redux state
      between page transitions.
